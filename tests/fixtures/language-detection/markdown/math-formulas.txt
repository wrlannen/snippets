# Algorithm Complexity

The time complexity can be expressed as:

$$T(n) = O(n \log n)$$

For space complexity, we have:

$$S(n) = O(n)$$

The recurrence relation:

$$
T(n) = \begin{cases}
1 & \text{if } n = 1 \\
2T(n/2) + n & \text{if } n > 1
\end{cases}
$$

This is typical of divide-and-conquer algorithms like merge sort.
