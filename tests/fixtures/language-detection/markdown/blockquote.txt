This quote perfectly captures the spirit of innovation in technology. Kay's work at Xerox PARC led to many foundational concepts we use today:

- Object-oriented programming
- Graphical user interfaces
- The Dynabook concept (precursor to tablets)

His vision continues to inspire new generations of developers and designers.
