Recipe: Chocolate Chip Cookies

Ingredients:
Two cups all purpose flour
One teaspoon baking soda
Half teaspoon salt
One cup butter, softened
Three quarters cup granulated sugar
Three quarters cup packed brown sugar
Two large eggs
Two teaspoons vanilla extract
Two cups chocolate chips

Instructions:

Preheat your oven to three hundred seventy five degrees Fahrenheit. Line baking sheets with parchment paper.

In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.

In a large bowl, cream together the butter and both sugars until light and fluffy, about three minutes. Beat in the eggs one at a time, then stir in the vanilla.

Gradually blend in the flour mixture until just combined. Fold in the chocolate chips.

Drop rounded tablespoons of dough onto the prepared baking sheets, spacing them about two inches apart.

Bake for nine to eleven minutes, or until the edges are golden brown. The centers may look slightly underdone.

Allow cookies to cool on the baking sheet for five minutes before transferring to a wire rack.

Makes approximately four dozen cookies.
