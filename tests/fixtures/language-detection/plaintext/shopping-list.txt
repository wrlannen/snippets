Shopping list for the week:

Milk and eggs from the store on Main Street. Don't forget to check if they have organic options.

Fresh vegetables including carrots, broccoli, and spinach. The farmer's market usually has better prices.

Bread from the bakery. Get the whole wheat loaf this time.

Remember to bring reusable bags!
