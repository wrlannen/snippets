The History of Coffee

Coffee originated in Ethiopia, where legend says a goat herder named Kaldi discovered the energizing effects of coffee beans after noticing his goats became unusually lively after eating berries from a certain tree.

By the fifteenth century, coffee was being cultivated in Yemen. The drink spread through the Middle East, eventually reaching Europe in the seventeenth century. Coffee houses became popular gathering places for intellectual discussion and commerce.

Today, coffee is one of the most traded commodities in the world. Brazil remains the largest producer, followed by Vietnam and Colombia. The industry supports millions of farmers and workers across the globe.

Modern coffee culture has evolved to include countless brewing methods and specialty drinks. From espresso to cold brew, the humble coffee bean continues to adapt to changing tastes while remaining a beloved daily ritual for billions of people.
