// Meeting Notes

We discussed the upcoming project launch and decided on the following action items:

The team needs to complete the testing phase by next Friday. This includes both unit tests and integration tests.

John will coordinate with the design team to finalize the UI mockups. Sarah mentioned she can help with the documentation.

We should schedule a follow-up meeting to review progress. Let's plan for next Tuesday at 2pm.
