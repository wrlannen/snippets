Subject: Unable to access account after password reset

Description:
I tried to reset my password yesterday using the forgot password link. I received the reset email and created a new password. However, when I try to log in with the new password, I get an error message saying my credentials are invalid.

I have tried:
- Clearing browser cache and cookies
- Using a different browser
- Requesting another password reset

Nothing seems to work. I need access to my account urgently for work purposes.

Agent Notes:
Checked system logs. Password reset completed successfully at 2:47 PM on January 13. Account shows no lockout status. Escalating to technical team for investigation.
