Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the Marketing Coordinator position advertised on your company website. With three years of experience in digital marketing and a passion for brand storytelling, I believe I would be a valuable addition to your team.

In my current role at Acme Corporation, I have successfully managed social media campaigns that increased engagement by forty percent. I also collaborated with cross-functional teams to launch two major product campaigns that exceeded their target metrics.

I am particularly drawn to your company because of its commitment to sustainable business practices. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my skills and enthusiasm could contribute to your marketing goals.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Jane Smith
