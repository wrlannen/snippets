Quick thoughts from today:

Finally figured out why the garden plants weren't doing well. Turns out I was overwatering them. The tomatoes especially need time to dry out between waterings. Made a note to only water twice a week going forward.

Had lunch with Tom from the old office. Hard to believe it's been five years since we worked together. He mentioned they're looking for contractors if I ever want some side work.

The car is making that weird noise again. Need to take it to the mechanic before it turns into something expensive. Maybe Saturday morning when they're less busy.

Reminder to call mom this weekend. It's been too long.
